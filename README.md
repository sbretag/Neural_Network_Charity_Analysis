# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

  - Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
  - Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
  - Optimize the model
  - Produce a written report on the Neural Network Model

## Resources

  - Software: Python, Visual Studio, & Jupyter Lab
  - Date Source:
  - Code
    - Alphabet IPYNB Link
    - Alphabet Optimization Link


## Results

### Data Preprocessing
  - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model
  - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model
  - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural netwokr model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

### Summary
  - Summarize the overall results of the deep leaerning model.  Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classifcation probrem, and explain your recommendation
